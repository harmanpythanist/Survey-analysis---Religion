Excited to share the successful completion of a survey analysis project I worked on with a team!

Topic: Religion in East Asian Countries

Data Source: Pew Research Center


**About Dataset:**

The dataset originates from the Pew Research Center's survey on religion and spirituality in East Asia, conducted in 2023. The survey collected responses from 10,390 adults across five locations: Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Data was gathered using computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI) to ensure high accuracy

**Analyzed aspects from the dataset:**

Believe in existence on God and Unseen creatures
One Religion or Multiple religions can be true 
Freedom of speech in different religions
Importance of funeral rituals 
Deeply studying Buddhist Responses

---

**Moreover, we graphed responses of daily life matters like:**

Who should be primarily responsible for making family decisions? 
Who should be primarily responsible for taking care of children? 
Who should be primarily responsible for earning money? 

One significant finding from the analysis is that religious factors have little influence on the responses. Across various questions—whether related to beliefs, family responsibilities, or daily life practices—respondents from different religious backgrounds provided remarkably similar answers. A possible explanation for this trend is the impact of social media, which has enhanced global interaction and communication more than ever before. People freely share their opinions, thoughts, and experiences, fostering a greater sense of connection across cultural and religious boundaries. Additionally, the widespread celebration of cultural and religious events worldwide may contribute to a blending of perspectives, leading to more aligned viewpoints across diverse groups.

This project was a collaborative effort with Sharmeen Abdul Waheed, Usama Khan, and Warda Ali, whose contributions were integral to the analysis and insights we documented.
